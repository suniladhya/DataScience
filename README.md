## Common Data Science tasks
### Description
    Describe patterns and trends lying within the Data.
    e.g, High no. of calls may imply unsatisfied customers. 
         Descriptive statistics can provide the lifetime avg of a player 
### Estimation
    Approximation of numerical value using a collection of predictor value.
    Estimation models are built using records where target values are unknown.
    e.g, Mortgage Amount a person can afford based on personal and demographic factors.
### Classification
    Classification is similar to estimation, except that the target variable is categorical rather than continious.
    e.g, A mortgage lender would be interested in determining which of the customers are likely to default on Mortgage Loans.
### Clustering
    It is the task to identify the groups of records which are similar.
    e.g, In a Dataset of credit card of applicants, one cluster represent the younger and educated customers.
         Another old and less educated
    use case: Client may be interested in cluster profiles
              clusters may be used as the inputs to classify or estimate the models down the line.
### Prediction
    It is similar to classification and estimation, except that for prediction the forecasts relate to the future.
    e.g, stock price predictipon
### Association
    It involves determining which attributes are associated with each other. i.e, which attributes goes togeather.
    To uncover the rules to quatify the relation ship between two or more attributes.
    it takes the form, "If Antecedant than consequent".
